Gearbox Tools
=============
This is the generic template work extracted from acts_as_authenticated and action_mailer_tls.

Difference
==========
* by default ActionController:Base is mixed with lib/authenticated_system.rb
* No testing support (the test code is a mess...) but authenticated_test_helper still exists to help on doing other testing
* AppConfig support for configuring smtp and various app settings (see config/app_config.yml)

What the installation does
==========================
* Install Generators for authentication package (named: auth)
* Auto-Install action_mailer_tls fork (with optional tls support)

Things to do after install
==========================
run script/generate auth to generate all authentication related files
run script/generate common to generate other helpers
- app_config.yml with initializer
- mail_config initializer
- jquery initializer if you want to use jquery (remove it from config/initializers if you don't need it)
